ðŸ‘¸Sudoku Solver using Backtracking Algorithm
This repository contains a simple yet efficient implementation of a Sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm.

ðŸ‘¸ About Sudoku Solver
The solver is designed to tackle standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles. It employs a backtracking strategy, systematically exploring possibilities by filling cells with numbers from 1 to 9, checking for validity at each step, and backtracking when an invalid state is encountered. This process continues until a solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

ðŸ‘¸ Usage
The solver is written in C++ and provides a straightforward approach to solve Sudoku puzzles. It includes backtracking to find a solution for the given puzzle.

ðŸ‘¸ Getting Started
    To use the solver:

1.Clone or download this repository.
2.Provide the unsolved Sudoku puzzle as a 9x9 grid with empty cells represented as 0.
3.Compile and run the program.

ðŸ‘¸ Acknowledgments
This solver is inspired by the backtracking algorithm's elegance and effectiveness in solving constraint-based problems like Sudoku.
